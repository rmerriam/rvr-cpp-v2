# RVR C++

This repository contains a C++ implementation of the  serial communications protocol for the RVR robot. This started out by reverse engineering the protocol from the microBits and Raspberry Pi SDKs. The SDK is at https://sdk.sphero.com/getting_started/. 

The Wiki explains the details of the protocol with some code snippets.
